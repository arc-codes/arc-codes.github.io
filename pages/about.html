                    Hello, I'm Aaron. Just another guy who has started to blog.
                    I'm hoping this will be a nice online space full of interesting things, technical things, project updates, howto's and various rants.
                    </p><p>
                    I Currently work for the Academy of Interactive Entertainment as a Games Programming Teacher / Software developer in Sydney Australia.
                    Here i get a chance to convert normal people into a life of insanity consisting of sleepless nights dreaming of code and that one un unsolved problem that keeps us up at night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    During my free time when i'm not ranting about coding standards or naming conventions, I like to tinker with various technologies, new programming languages, old programming languages, web development, game development, you name it, i've probably played with it.
                    </p>
                    Feel free to check out some of my personal projects, or read through some blog posts.
